    <p>I grew up playing sports for as long as I can remember. I have two very profund memories from prior to 2010 that I remember growing up was when I was 3 years old playing Tee ball and playing Mini hockey with my dad in the living room. When I became old enough I played as many sports as possible and that continued all the way up to the last year of high school. I played volleyball, basketball, soccer, baseball, you name it i played. I also wanted to be on every sports team possible because it mean't a free day of playing sports and nothing sounds more appealing to me than 'sports all day'. My main sport was hockey then in my grade 9 year of high school I played Lacrosse for the first time and it was history since. I fell in love with the game and now here I am playing at the University of Ottawa for the Mens team. The mens lacrosse team has a pretty big instagram following. 
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uottawalacrosse/"> Their Instagram</a>  As a team we like to use the social media to promote team events or charity games that we do. For example this past weekend we played a game against Queens University. The game was not just a regular game, it was a game for Beau. A minor lacrosse player who was coming home from a tournament got into a car accident with his father. His father did not comeout of the crash and beau was in a coma for a month or two. We posted the link on our instagram and made it clear all the funds donated at the game would be going straight to Beau and his family. 
      <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/gvjpq-battle-for-beau"> Donations for Battle for Beau.</a> 
      Overall, If I had to choose my 3 favourite sports, I think my top 3 would be: 
      <li> Lacrosse</li>
      <li> Hockey </li>
      <li> Basketball</li>
